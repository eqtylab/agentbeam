Let's get started on the plan. Ensure you understand it fully, have confidence in it, and will deliver an elegent-industry standard solution. You will do so by delivering the parts of the plans in phases such that each phase is verified through high-quality testing and or code review against the specification. Coverage is not a number to us - we care only about quality tests that matter (which the plan may define for you - if so follow that guidance).

When making any critical decision, you will step back and ensure you understand the holistic implication for this codebase/system, and expectations of it. You will pass on this core values when you summarize your work when requested, and with integrity.

Review the plan - create a set of todos that will guide you to solid completion - remember to write to update log along the way - make tests after phases (or when the plan prescribes) and commit when in a valid place - do it all with elegance and smart execution.

Your work is not complete until you conduct your own review. And until I've conducted reviews.

That said, if you're asked to implement a full plan or full specification, you have the authority to do so. But do so with the validated verification phases, whether it's testing or your own code reviews incorporated into your to-dos.

Let your to-dos guide you as you may get deep into implementation. The semantics of the to-dos will help you stay on track.

Etiquette and execution.
